            <h2>Who is Heritage Burnaby?</h2>
            <p>Heritage Burnaby is an online repository for Burnaby's historical archives. They have an interactive map called the Charting Change Atlas which was created in 2010 to showcase how Burnaby's landscape has changed over time. It was made with the purpose to "better serve Burnaby's citizens by providing more opportunities to learn about the City's heritage and history."</p>
            <div class="img-text-2columns">
              <img src="img/old-charting.png" alt="The old charting change atlas"/>
              <div class="text-with-img"><p class="highlight-green">Since launching in 2010, <span>the interactive map was initially popular but gradually lost its audiences and became inactive, leading our client to wonder whether the map had potential in drawing current interest if it was redesigned</span>.</p></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="project-section part-bold">
            <h2>Discovery</h2>
            <h3>User Testing & Interviews</h3>
            <p>In order to understand the reasons why users are not motivated to engage with the map like when it was released, the team decided to conduct user interviews with prospective users of the map to find out their frustrations, needs and goals with the existed map.
              <ul>
                <li><span>Format:</span> in-person usability testing with think-aloud method and semi-structured interviews</li>
                <li><span>Participants:</span> 3 Burnaby residents interested in Burnaby's history, 1 history student, and 1 museum researcher</li>
              </ul>
              </p>

            <h3>Synthesizing Research into Major Points</h3>
            <p>When I sat down to synthesize the information, I decided to set aside the comments about the unappealing UI and focus more on their experience and emotions while navigating the map:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Users find <span>it is unnecessary to use the map because they can always find historical information by googling</span>.</li>
                <li><span>Difficulty in navigation</span> due to the lack of essential tools like search bar or intuitive zoom feature causes frustration to the users.</li>
                <li>The exclusive information and photos from Heritage Burnaby are still informative and interesting to users.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="highlight-green">Based on the insights and the user journey, we decided to put <span>the need for inteventing a completely new way to revive the maps instead of just updating the user interface to be better</span>. Therefore, we targeted the maps on seniors who have memories with the heritages and people who like history.</p>

            <h2>Define</h2>
            <p>How might we making the map relevant to seniors and history lovers to increase people’s interest and engagement with the map while retaining it’s historical/informational value?</p>
          </div>

          <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Develop</h2>
            <h3>Participatory Workshop to Brainstorm Solutions</h3>
            <p>To promote innovation and ensure intended users' needs are met, the team host a workshop with 5 participants: 3 Burnaby residents interested in Burnaby's history, 1 history student, and 1 museum supervisor. </p>

             <p>I structured the workshop activities based on our goal: to foster creativity in participants. The activities progressed from introducing them to the map to letting them rank the design concepts and add their thoughts, allowing us to gather real-time feedback on their attitudes toward design decisions.</p>

             <div><h3>Participatory Workshop insights</h3></div>
             <div class="large-quote"><p>“It doesn't feel like a StoryMap, it just looks like a regular map with historical information” </p></div>
             <!-- <p id="final-design-jump">The team initial concept was to gamifying the map so people can rank by uploading historical site’s images onto the map. However, the workshop helps us realize that photos are not enough, the community cares about stories. It also makes us realize that we also need to consider the back-end process for the museum staffs - the ones that need to approve uploaded content.</p> -->
             <p class="highlight-green">During the workshop, an urban planning assistant highlighted that the map, created with Esri's StoryMaps, lacked the essence of a true story map. This prompted me to research further, revealing that Esri's StoryMaps has grown from 100 maps in 2011 to 2.2 million in 2023, which suggests <span>there is value in the story mapping concept, but issues with its current execution</span>.</p>

                <p id="final-design-jump"><span>Active interest in story sharing among Burnaby residents!</span><br>A participant from the workshop led me to discover a Facebook group called Burnaby Nostalgia with over 10,000 members. Members shared photos and memories of historical and recreational sites and hundreds of likes and comments were being exchanged daily. This evidence drove me to propose transforming the map into a community story-sharing platform, integrating protected historical sites and beloved local spots.</p>

          <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Deliver</h2>
            <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
            <p>We redesigned the map into a community-driven story map, integrating local stories. By attracting visitors through personalized storytelling, the map allows anyone with a connection to Burnaby to share their stories and photos connected to historical landmarks on the map, which was a solution validated by findings from our participatory workshop.</p>

            <h3>Ideate</h3>
            <p>I looked at other map-based interfaces for inspiration and found the webpages for <a href="https://www.layersoflondon.org/map/browse">Layers of London</a> and <a href="https://www.airbnb.ca">Airbnb</a> to have the most relevant UI design elements to apply to our story map:
              <ul>
                <li>full screen map with minimizable side panel helps to optimize screen space</li>
                <li>multiple ways to navigate information (side panel suggestions, targeted search, and free discovery on map) gives users more freedom and control</li>
                <li>organizing map pinpoints in clusters helps reduce cognitive load</li>
              </ul></p>

            <img src="img/precedent-analysis.png" alt="Analysis of Layers of London and Airbnb"/>

            <p>Taking the elements from the precedents, I then created mid-fidelity wireframes to outline the user flow for the integration of the new community stories feature with the existing historical information, with consideration of the pain points from user research as well as key insights from the competitive analysis.</p>
