            <p>In this senior-level interaction design course, teams partnered with a client to help identify a problem with one of their products and design a solution using technology. Our team worked with Heritage Burnaby.</p>

            <p>The redesigned Heritage Burnaby map is catered towards Burnaby seniors and history lovers. It encourages community engagement by allowing anyone with a connection to Burnaby to share stories and photos linked to historical landmarks, bringing local history to life through interactive map visualizations.</p>
              
            <p>My main roles were synthesizing research, preparing activities for participatory workshop, conceptualizing the story map idea, wireframing and prototyping the story submission process on both user and client sides.</p>

            <p>Heritage Burnaby is an online repository for Burnaby's historical archives, with the goal of promoting knowledge and exploration of Burnaby's history and building community bonds. They have an interactive map called the Charting Change Atlas which was created in 2010 to showcase how Burnaby's landscape has changed over time.</p>

              <p class="text-with-img big-text">Since launching in 2010, the interactive map was initially popular but <span class="body-highlight">gradually lost its audiences and became inactive</span>, leading our client to wonder whether the map had potential in drawing current interest if it was redesigned.</p>

In order to understand the reasons why users are not motivated to engage with the map like when it was released, the team decided to conduct user interviews with these prospective users of the map to find out their frustrations, needs and goals with the map.

            <p>To promote innovation and discover design opportunities, the team host a workshop with 5 participants: 3 Burnaby residents interested in Burnaby's history, 1 history student, and 1 museum supervisor.</p>
            <p>During the workshop, an urban planning assistant highlighted that <span class="body-highlight">the map, created with Esri's StoryMaps, lacked the essence of a true story map</span>. This prompted me to research further, revealing that Esri's StoryMaps has grown from 100 maps in 2011 to 2.2 million in 2023, which suggests <span class="body-highlight">there is value in the story mapping concept, but issues with its current execution</span>.</p>

                <p>This evidence drove me to propose transforming the map into a community story-sharing platform, integrating protected historical sites and beloved local spots.</p>

          <p>I started the ideation process by sketching down the layout for the main screens of our interaction. The team ended up going with the layout I sketched, but adapted some changes like <span class="body-highlight">changing the icon buttons to labeled buttons for seniors to easily recognize them and know what they are used for</span>.</p>

          <p class="process-header add-space">Mid-fidelity wireframes/user flow</p>
          <p>Since I had already sketched out the flow for the story submission process, I took charge of creating the mid-fidelity wireframes to fine-tune the overall user flow for it. I chose Montserrat as the typeface because it is used on the main Heritage Burnaby website, and adapted some UI elements like the search button from their main pages to maintain branding consistency.

          <p class="process-header add-space">Early-stage analysis with client to discover potential issues</p>
          <p>After finishing the mid-fidelity, we had a quick sesssion with Heritage Burnaby's curator to identify potential issues. For the story submission flow, I was able to get these two key insights:</p>
          <div class="two-text-columns">
            <div class="text-column">
              <p class="caption">Photo Copyright Notice</p>
              <p>It's important for users to know that  they retain full ownership of the copyright to any images they upload, and they agree to share the photos with Heritage Burnaby.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="text-column">
              <p class="caption">Missing Story Screening Process</p>
              <p>Since there may be issues related to photo copyright and content, Heritage Burnaby need to review and audit the stories before they are published.</p>
            </div>
            <p></p>
          </div>

          <p class="process-header">Refined Interface</p>
          <p>Taking the insights from the analysis, I was able to finalize the final interface for the story submission, with addition to the client side for reviewing the stories.</p>
