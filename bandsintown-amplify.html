            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project was a part of an advanced level course that examines design practice of Interaction and User Experience Design. I was mainly responsible for the experimental visual direction, interactions, and prototyping as one of the visual designers of the team. Below is an advertising video I made for our intervention:</p>

            <h2>Choosing our Domain and Client</h2>
            <p>We began the project by identifying a group of individuals within a specific sector who had unmet needs, goals, and challenges, and from there choosing a client that can deliver our solution for that group's need.</p>
            <p>Our team dedicated significant time to this initial phase, conducting in-depth research across more than 30 domains spanning various industries within three weeks. We continuously refined our focus, striving to define the ideal experience problem that would lead to a compelling design project. During the process, I discovered the financial struggles local music venues faced after COVID-19 and brought the issue to the team. Ultimately, we chose to tackle the <span>challenges faced by local music artists and small venues</span>, and our chosen client is <span>Bandsintown</span>.</p>

Therefore, governments, people in power as well as music fans should now do their utmost to <mark class="half-background">safeguard the spaces that have been a lifeline for artists and a cultural force for society as a whole</mark>.”</p>

                <h3>Local Artists</h3>
                <p>To better understanding the target audience's goals and challanges, I did some research on recent peer review articles on the current situation of Canada's local music scene. The papers mainly focus on issues within main cities including Toronto and Vancouver.</p>
                  
                <p>Local independent artists handle their own music production, promotion, and networking. Engaging with their local scene can facilitate opportunities with artists, venues, and other scene participants.</p>

                    <p><span>Challenges</span></br>
                    Artists have to handle their own booking and promotion. A lack of connection to booking processes makes it difficult to connect to other artists and venues.</p>
                  
                    <p><span>Behaviours</span></br>
                    Artists reach out to other artists to build a bill on Instagram. After accommodating all participating musicians’ schedules, an email is sent to the chosen venue to request to perform.</p>
                  
                    <p><span>Needs</span></br>
                    Getting involved in the local music scene through performing at local venues. Through engaging with others at shows, they look to connect with peers to form more creative opportunities.</p>

            <h2>Testing concept</h2>

            <h3>Interviews with local Vancouver artists</h3>
            <p>Our primary objective was to explore the booking experience from the artist’s perspective. We interviewed 4 local music artists to understand their current process, the challenges they face, and determining whether our proposed intervention would address their needs and add value.</p>

            <div class="large-quote">
              <p>“Right now its really about knowing the right people... There are people who want to play shows but don't know about the process or how to access the process”</p>

            <h3>Insights from the interviews</h3>
            <p><span>Booking Experience:</span></br>
              <ul>
                <li>Pre-show and post-show touch points are equally—if not more—important for small artists and venues in organizing a successful live show, yet its never fully addressed on the platform.</li>
                <li>Through the interviews, we learned that <span>the common booking process starts from artists forming a “bill” themselves</span>, which is a list of artists that are going to perform, and send the bill to venues for approval. </li>
                <li>However, <span>this process requires the artists going back and forth</span> and have to managing connecting with every single band in the bill and venues, on top of their music practices.</li>
              </ul></p>
              
            <p><span>Networking in the Local Music Scene: </span></br>
              <ul>
                <li>Through our interviews, it became clear that connections are not just important—they're everything. </li>
                <li id="final-intervention-jump">Networking plays a crucial role in securing gigs, collaborating with other artists, and gaining visibility in the community, often determining the success or stagnation of an artist’s career at the local level.</li>

            <p>This was definitely the most impressive and demanding project I've ever worked on, especially considering that all of the visual direction, interaction design, and prototyping occurred within two weeks, with the final week in which we transitioned entirely from a website version to a mobile version after discovering that artists primarily use mobile devices to form gigs with each other.

            <p>As one of the lead visual designers, I was responsible for creating the UI components of the work you see above. This project taught me a lot about the design process and research. As our first experience design project, our group struggled to identify the right problems to tackle and to pair them with research that would drive effective solutions. It reinforced the importance of not designing in isolation and of challenging every assumption through research-driven insights.</p>
