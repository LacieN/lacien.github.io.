            <p>This project was part of an advanced-level course that examines the design practices of Interaction and User Experience Design. Bandsintown Amplify provides solutions for local music artists who face challenges booking shows and building connections within their local music scene.</p>

            <p>I led the interface and interaction design for the Bookings feature, which facilitates scheduling between artists and venues. The feature ensures that artists can invite other bands and book venues that are available to all participating bands in one platform.</p>

            <p>During the process of exploring this domain, I came across <a class="in-text-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45251915_The_DIY_artist_Issues_of_sustainability_within_local_music_scenes">an article</a> highlighting how local artists often have to manage every aspect of their work, from creation to marketing, sales, and logistics, entirely on their own. 
            </p>
            <img class="diy-model-space" src="img/bandsintown-diy-model.png" alt="arrow-point">
            <p>This insight prompted us to conduct interviews with four local Vancouver artists to better understand their workflows and pain points. Our goal was to uncover opportunities where design could intervene to ease one or more touchpoints in their creative and operational processes.</p>

            <p class="sub-head add-space">The problem based on the interview's insights</p>
            <p class="problem-statement">Local artists have a hard time booking shows because the process is time-consuming and depends too much on who you know.</p>

                <p class="pain-point-header">When you're the one setting up the show, you have to juggle every person's schedule.</p>
                <p>The booking process starts from artists forming a “bill", which is a list of artists that are going to perform and send it to venues. This process wastes time as the artists have to go back and forth trying to manage a day works for everybody in the bill and the venues.</p>

                <p>Small venues often operate without dedicated booking agents who book artists for the venues, making the responsibility lying on artists to discover venues' availabilities themselves.</p>

            <p class="sub-head also-add-space">Ideation and early-stage wireframes</p>
            <p>As many artists struggle to find gigs and form a full lineup, I proposed a flow where venues could post available slots for shows, and artists could book them without needing to network. I created quick interactive low-fidelity wireframes to test this idea with two artists who have played a few shows before.</p>
            <p>The testing results showed that they didn't understand it as a system where they could book a spot to perform, but rather as a platform to find concerts to attend and network. This was when we realized the importance of networking and following the traditional processes that artists usually rely on.</p>
            <img class="diy-model-space" src="img/bandsintown-early-wireframes.png" alt="Bandsintown's Early Wireframes">

            <p class="sub-head">Proposed user-flow & first prototype iteration</p>
            <p>Based on the initial testing, the new user flow is created to help artists find concerts to go and connect with new artists, while booking remains the core feature to help users easily form bills and book venues.</p>
            <p>I was in charge of creating the wireframe for the landing page and the first few screens of the booking process. While creating the prototype, I made a design system using Figma components to make sure that the UI was cohesive across the website.</p>

            <p>An online usability test using the think-aloud method and semi-structured interviews with 1 new and 2 experienced Vancouver artists was conducted to ensure our insights reflect the app's primary target audience. I assisted in synthesizing the testing results, and here are the primary issues I found during testing:</p>

                <p>Users find the review system in which artists review venues and vice versa gives venues too much power. They worry about receiving bad reviews but also find overly positive reviews unhelpful.</p>

              <div class="text-column">
                <p class="caption">Difficulty in understanding “pending” concert</p>
                <p>Users misunderstand the 'pending' concert status, thinking they haven't finished the bill and are still in the process of submitting it to venues, rather than waiting for venue confirmation.</p>

              <div class="text-column">
                <p class="caption">Lack in Providing Venue’s Information</p>

            <p class="problem-statement">“Bandsintown's ethos is independent at the core, serving artists since day one of their journey. Independent venues shed light on those artists early in their career.” </br> <span class="bandsintwon-quote">- Fabrice Sergent, Co-Founder & Managing Partner, Bandsintown Group</span></p>
            <p>Bandsintown's brand value perfectly aligns with the problem we are planning to tackle: helping local artists in the early days of their careers. However, the current Bandsintown platform focuses primarily on helping artists with promotions catered toward artist-to-fan interactions, with less emphasis on the crucial booking steps and the connection between artists and venues that occur before a show is organized and scheduled.</p>
            <p>By providing additional services to venues and artists, Bandsintown can extend its offerings beyond promotions and into the broader live music discovery ecosystem, enhancing the platform’s value for both venues and artists.</p>

           <h3 id="reflection" class="anchor-target">Reflection</h3>
           <p>This was definitely the most impressive and demanding project I've ever worked on, especially considering that all of the visual direction, interaction design, and prototyping occurred within two weeks, with the final week in which we transitioned entirely from a website version to a mobile version after discovering that artists primarily use mobile devices to form gigs with each other.</p>

           <p>As one of the lead visual designers, I was responsible for creating the UI components of the work you see above. This project taught me a lot about the design process and research. As our first experience design project, our group struggled to identify the right problems to tackle and to pair them with research that would drive effective solutions. It reinforced the importance of not designing in isolation and of challenging every assumption through research-driven insights.</p>
